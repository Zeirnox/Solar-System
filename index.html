    <section class="sun">
      <h1>The Sun</h1>
      <p>
        Star Type: Yellow Dwarf<br>
        Age: 4.6 Billion Years
      </p>
      <p>
        <br>
        The Sun—the heart of our solar system—is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases.<br>

        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest
        particles of debris in its orbit.
        Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar
        wind—a stream of electrically
        charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.<br>

        The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate,
        radiation belts and aurorae.
        Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and closest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's
        Moon.
        Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from
        Earth,
        and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
        Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense
        atmosphere.

    <section class="venus">
      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
        It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
        similar in size and density.
        These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
        <br> <br>
        Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick,
        yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet
        in our solar system,
        even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475
        degrees Celsius) –
        hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and
        thousands of large volcanoes.
        Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.

    <section class="earth">
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by
        living things. <br>
        <br>
        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with
        liquid water on the surface.
        Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of
        which are made of rock and metal.

    <section class="mars">
      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>
        ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. 
        Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. 
        <br>
        Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.

    <section class="jupiter">
      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. 
        That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
        <br>
        Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – 
        more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
        <br>
        Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, 
        floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is 
        a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.

    <section class="saturn">
      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.
        <br>
        Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. 
        It is not the only planet to have rings—made of chunks of ice and rock—but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
        <br>
        Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

    <section class="uranus">
      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, 
        although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
        <br>
        It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. 
        Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. 
        Instead the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.​

    <section class="neptune">
      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.
        <br>
        More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye 
        and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
        <br>
        NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.
