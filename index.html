      <h1>The Sun</h1>
      <p>
        Star Type: Yellow Dwarf<br>
        Age: 4.6 Billion Years 
      </p>
      <p> <br>
        The Sun—the heart of our solar system—is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases.<br>

        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest
        particles of debris in its orbit.
        Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar
        wind—a stream of electrically
        charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.<br>

        The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate,
        radiation belts and aurorae.
        Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy

      <p>
        Mercury—the smallest planet in our solar system and closest to the Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's
        Moon.
        Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.

        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from
        Earth,
        and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
        Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense
        atmosphere.
